<h2>Quickstart</h2>

<p>For the different proposals, keep reading this document. Implementation guides for some of these proposals are <a href="Testing-Guide-Proposal-3">here</a>. </p>

<h2>Run tests as container orchestrator jobs (run based)</h2>

<p>For the detailed guide go <a href="Testing-Guide-Proposal-3">here</a>.</p>

<p>Create tests as container orchestrator runs, using the ability of the container orchestrator to treat the container as an environment (hence, you can run multiple commands). Based on the idea of proposal 5, we inject the testing logic into the original container (but this is not executed when building, hence doesn't increase the size of the container) as bash scripts.</p>

<pre><code>FROM ubuntu:16.04
MAINTAINER PhenoMeNal-H2020 Project ( phenomenal-h2020-users@googlegroups.com )

# install packages required to run app
RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y \
    "&lt;app runtime=""&gt; and &lt;dependencies&gt;" \  # add app runtime and required packages
    &amp;&amp; rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# copy app files
COPY app app
COPY run.sh run.sh

# copy test logic
ADD runTest1.sh /usr/local/bin/runTest1.sh
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/runTest1.sh
ADD runTest1.sh /usr/local/bin/runTest2.sh
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/runTest2.sh

# main app entrypoint
...
</code></pre>

<p>Then after this has been built and pushed to the docker registry, it can be run in the container orchestrator executing the <code>runTest1.sh</code> and <code>runTest2.sh</code>, possibly through separate Jenkins jobs for granularity.

<h3>Pros</h3>

<ul>
<li>Can be naturally outsourced to the container orchestrator for heavy computation.</li>
<li>It tests the container very much in the same context that it should see on a production environment (being pulled from a registry, run inside the container orchestration, receiving a command and possibly mounting volumes if needed).</li>
<li>Doesn't require extra Dockefile (as in the build based cases) nor repos.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons</h3>

<ul>
<li>Might require additional effort to add as a job in the CI.</li>
</ul>
