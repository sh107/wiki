<p>The Galaxy release procedure aims to fix all versions of tools used by Galaxy, and the Galaxy version itself, towards a major PhenoMeNal release. For Galaxy itself, this is achieved as with any other container, through the container release procedure. For tools within Galaxy, for a tool that has a release tag pushed by the CI (Jenkins):</p>

<ol>
<li>Obtain the release tag to be used for the tool container, which is available at <a href="http://phenomenal-h2020.eu/jenkins/">Jenkins</a>. For instance, as of March 2017, the latest release tag for Iso2Flux tool was <code>v0.2_cv1.0.28</code> and is produced by this <a href="http://phenomenal-h2020.eu/jenkins/job/container-iso2flux/28/">building job</a>. Tags starting with <code>dev_</code> or <code>rc_</code> 
1.1. The main developer/maintainer of the container should ideally communicate this desired version to the Galaxy container maintainer.
1.2. The version of the container should be generating successful test runs, available <a href="http://phenomenal-h2020.eu/jenkins/view/%20B.-%20Container%20data%20tests/">here</a>.
1.3. If the tool participates in a Galaxy workflow, it should have a successful integration test for all workflows it participates <a href="http://phenomenal-h2020.eu/jenkins/view/%20C.-%20Integration%20tests/">here</a>.</li>
<li>If not open already, a git flow release process should be opened for this Galaxy container release.</li>
<li>Within the release branch of the Galaxy container, make sure that the correct version of the container in process of being added to the release is used in <code>config/job_conf.xml</code> file of the Galaxy container, in the appropiate destination entry for the container, in the <code>docker_tag_override</code> entry. Following the Iso2flux example, this looks like:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>    &lt;destinations default="local"&gt;
        ...other destinations...
        &lt;destination id="iso2flux-container" runner="k8s"&gt;
            &lt;param id="docker_repo_override"&gt;container-registry.phenomenal-h2020.eu&lt;/param&gt;
            &lt;param id="docker_owner_override"&gt;phnmnl&lt;/param&gt;
            &lt;param id="docker_image_override"&gt;iso2flux&lt;/param&gt;
            &lt;param id="docker_tag_override"&gt;v0.2_cv1.0.28&lt;/param&gt;
            &lt;param id="max_pod_retrials"&gt;1&lt;/param&gt;
            &lt;param id="docker_enabled"&gt;true&lt;/param&gt;
        &lt;/destination&gt;
        ...other destinations...
    &lt;/destinations&gt;
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Update any necessary files in <code>tools/phenomenal/path/to/tool</code>, including the main XML wrapper if it is outdated from the tool repo.</li>
<li>Start the Galaxy container in development mode using minikube, to check that files added don't break the Galaxy installation.</li>
<li>Ideally, try the tool manually with some data.</li>
<li>Commit changes for the tool to the release branch, and push to the branch. The CI will create from release branches an <code>rc_</code> tagged container image and a latest, so make sure that the commit doesn't break Galaxy startup (previous point).</li>
</ol>

<p>As all tools are fixed to a version, and the Galaxy instance is working correctly, make a symbolic pull request from the release branch to master, and ask for reviews of other core developers. When this is accepted, lift the ban to push to master, finalise the git flow release process for the Galaxy container locally, and then push these changes. You have now a PhenoMeNal Galaxy release tagged and build to be part of a major PhenoMeNal release.</p>
